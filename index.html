    <p>This is my favorite anime at the moment. It is based off the Chinese Zodiacs and is a very cute slice of life anime. The main character is a female named Tohru Honda and she is kind of an airhead, but she stumbles into this exciting situation when she begins living with the Sohma Family! While living with Yuki, Shigure and Kyo, Tohru makes herself at home and slowly meeting the zodiacs along the way. This family is nowhere near perfect, but they certainly are an interesting bunch. It truly is never a normal day in this home because you never know who will drop in. Not to mention Tohru has to be very careful because if she hugs any of the male members of the Sohma family they turn into their Zodiac counterpart.</p>
    <p>The anime as a whole is cute and filled with romance is definitely a must watch anime! You have the classic love triangle not to mention quirky characters and an entertaining storyline with a villain that is the head of the Sohma family! There are actually two versions of the anime along with the manga. One is an older version and a completely different art style while the newer anime changes things up with a more modern art style and some changes in the plot. The Manga though is the completely original story! You cannot go wrong with any of them. No matter what version you choose this is an amazing story all together!</p>

    <p>I definitely recommend watching this anime do to the fact it is a shorter anime with only three seasons in total and it truly can keep you entertained the whole time you are watching. The character dynamic is amazing to watch and as a whole you see them mature as characters and the ending is a tear-jerker for sure. If you can watch that without crying there may be something wrong with you.</p>
